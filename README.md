# Property based testing examples based on [fast-check](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check)

This repository contains multiple tests exclusively written using property based testing approach.

Remember that property based does not replace by no means classical example based ones.
Meanwhile they allow to cover a larger range of inputs and can potentially catch problems not seen by examples.
